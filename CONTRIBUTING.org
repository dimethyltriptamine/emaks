* Contributing to my Emacs config

Altough this is *my* emacs configuration, you can contribute to it!
Since I have a lot of mirrors in different git hosting services, you
should send me a .patch file wherever you can. You can also merge
request (in gitlab) or pull request (in github), i'll manage to make
it work. but if you can just use a .patch, that would be very nice.
